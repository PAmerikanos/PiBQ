# Legacy Code

**Caution: The code in this directory is considered legacy and is not actively maintained.**

This directory contains older versions of scripts, experimental code, or components that have been superseded by newer implementations in the main project directory.

## Key Points:
- **No Active Maintenance**: These files are not regularly updated, tested, or guaranteed to work with the current version of the project.
- **Potential Incompatibilities**: The code may use outdated libraries, APIs, or methodologies that are no longer compatible with the current system.
- **Use at Your Own Risk**: If you choose to use or adapt any code from this directory, do so with caution. Thorough testing and understanding of the code will be necessary.
- **For Reference Only**: This code is primarily kept for historical reference or for specific, isolated use cases where its functionality might still be relevant under controlled conditions.

It is recommended to use the actively maintained versions of scripts and modules available in the root of the project or other designated active directories.
