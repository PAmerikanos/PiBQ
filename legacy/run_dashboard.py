LEGACY SCRIPT: Not actively maintained.
Original purpose: To run a simple Bokeh dashboard displaying real-time temperature
readings from a single MCP9600 thermocouple sensor.

This script initializes an MCP9600 sensor and uses Bokeh to create a live-updating
line graph of the temperature. The x-axis represents time, and the y-axis
represents the temperature read from the sensor.

Note: This script is designed for a specific, older setup and may require
adjustments or specific library versions (e.g., Bokeh 2.4.3 as mentioned in
the legacy README) to run correctly. It is superseded by the Dash application
in the main project directory.
